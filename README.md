**Welcome to MojiiCore -  A Vision for the Future of Expressive AI Chat.** 🌍✨

MojiiCore is an **ambitious open-source project** aiming to create a text-based chat platform that brings conversations to life with **frame-perfect, dynamically animated emojis**. We envision combining the intelligence of **locally run open-source LLMs (like DeepSeek-R1)** with the visual richness of **WebAssembly-accelerated, WebGL-powered emoji animations**.

**MojiiCore** aspires to be more than just chat; it's a **dynamic, expressive communication experience** where emojis become **living, breathing elements** of your conversations, reacting in real-time to the context and sentiment of your messages!

**Our Guiding Principles: Open Source, Expressive Communication for the AI Era**

This project is in **early development** and is currently driven by a **single developer** with a passion for open source and a vision for the future of communication. We are guided by these core principles:

*   **Open Source First:**  MojiiCore is built on open source principles from the ground up. Transparency, community involvement, and collaborative development are at the heart of this project.
*   **Local-First AI:**  We prioritize using open-source LLMs that can be run locally, ensuring user privacy and data control.
*   **Expressive Communication:**  We believe that digital communication should be rich, engaging, and fun. Animated emojis are a key part of this vision.
*   **Community-Driven Innovation:**  We hope to foster a vibrant community of developers, designers, animators, and emoji enthusiasts to help shape MojiiCore's future.
*   **Democratizing Advanced Technology:** We aim to leverage technologies like WebAssembly and WebGL to bring high-performance, delightful experiences to everyone, freely available through open source.

**🔥 Core Features (Planned):**

*   **Live, Context-Driven Emoji Animations:** Emojis will animate in real-time based on the text content and sentiment of the conversation. (Currently in the conceptual phase.)
*   **Frame-Perfect 60fps Animations:**  We aim for smooth and responsive animations powered by WebAssembly and WebGL 2.0. (Future implementation)
*   **AI-Powered by Open-Source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1):**  The goal is to enable intelligent conversations with locally running, open-source LLMs.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed for extensibility and customization.
*   **Extensible Animation System:** A framework for creating and adding new emoji animations and trigger rules.

**💎 Future Expansion (Potential Roadmap):**

*   **Advanced Analytics:** Sentiment tracking, conversation reports (potential future feature).
*   **Custom Integrations:** Connecting with other platforms (potential future feature).
*   **Enterprise Deployment Support:**  Scalable, secure deployments (potential future direction).

**🚀 Getting Started (Exploration & Development):**

Currently, MojiiCore is in the **early stages of development**. The primary focus now is on establishing the foundational architecture, exploring feasible implementation strategies for the core features (especially the animated emojis and LLM integration), and building a solid codebase.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd mojiicore
    ```

2. **Explore the Code:**  Familiarize yourself with the current project structure and the `README.md`.

3. **Set Up Development Environment:**  You'll likely need to set up a basic development environment with:
    *   **Frontend:**  A simple web server to serve `index.html` (or `npm` if you are using a build process).
    *   **Backend (if applicable):**  Python environment with necessary dependencies.
    *   **Signaling Server:**  A basic WebSocket server for client communication.

**Welcome to MojiiCore - A Vision for the Future of Expressive AI Chat.** 🌍✨

MojiiCore is an **ambitious open-source project** aiming to create a text-based chat platform that brings conversations to life with **frame-perfect, dynamically animated emojis**. We envision combining the intelligence of **locally run open-source LLMs (like DeepSeek-R1)** with the visual richness of **WebAssembly-accelerated, WebGL-powered emoji animations**.

## ✨ Why Real-Time Emoji Rendering Matters?

💨 **Instant Emotional Feedback**  
60fps animations synchronized with message delivery create visceral emotional connections

🎭 **Contextual Expressiveness**  
Dynamic facial expressions and motion paths adapt to conversation sentiment

⚡ **Technical Breakthrough**  
WebAssembly + WebGL pipeline enables cinematic quality in browser environments

🌐 **Universal Accessibility**  
Hardware-accelerated rendering maintains performance across devices

**🎯 What We Are Building (and NOT Building):**

*   **What We ARE Building:**
    *   A **unique chat platform** where emojis are **dynamically animated** in response to conversation context and sentiment.
    *   An **open-source foundation** for developers to integrate and experiment with various **locally-run open-source LLMs.**
    *   A **modular and extensible animation system** using WebAssembly and WebGL for optimal performance.
    *   A **vibrant community** around expressive communication and open-source AI.

*   **What We Are NOT Building (Initially):**
    *   **A new fine-tuned LLM:** We leverage existing open-source LLMs like DeepSeek-R1. Our focus is on the platform, animation, and integration, not on training new language models.
    *   **A fully-featured communication platform (yet):**  Early development focuses on the core concept: animated emojis + LLM-driven chat. Features like audio/video, user profiles, and extensive moderation tools will come later.

**Our Guiding Principles: Open Source, Privacy, Security, and Ethical Communication**

This project is in **early development** and is currently driven by a **single developer** with a passion for open source and a vision for the future of communication. We are guided by these core principles:

*   **Open Source First:** MojiiCore is built on open source principles from the ground up. Transparency, community involvement, and collaborative development are at the heart of this project.
*   **Sustainable Archiving:** All contributions are permanently preserved through [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), following their [archival guidelines](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/persistent-identifiers.html)
*   **Privacy by Design:** We are committed to maximizing user privacy.
    *   **Local-First AI:** We prioritize using open-source LLMs that can be run locally, ensuring your data stays on your own machine.
    *   **(Future) End-to-End Encryption:** When implemented, end-to-end encryption will ensure that only you and the intended recipients can read your messages.
*   **Security as a Priority:** We will strive to follow security best practices throughout the development process to protect users and their data.
    *   **(Future) Security Audits:** We plan to have regular security audits (both automated and manual) as the project matures.
